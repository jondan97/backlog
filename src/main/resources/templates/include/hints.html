        <p>This help may come in the form of tutorials, which explain some of the behaviour the user encounters in this application, or in the form of knowledge and descriptions, where a definition of a term found will be explained and tips and tricks will be given in order to use the Scrum framework effectively. In most cases, these hints will contain both, explained behaviour and definitions.<p>

    <h4 id="hintTitle-existingProjects" style="display: none">Existing Projects</h4>
    <div id="hintBody-existingProjects" style="display: none">
        <p><b>All the projects that exist in this application can be found here.</b><p>
        <p>Agile enthusiasts would prefer to use the term <b>product</b> instead of the word project.</p>
        <p>A product is something (physical or not), that is created through a development process and that provides value to the customer. A product could be anything, ranging from a software application to a service.</p>
        <p>The key part is the fact that the customer and their continuous feedback is valued more than the final product itself and the bureaucracy that it is surrounded by.</p>
        <p>An example product, would be something like this:</p>
        <p>Title: <b>Bike Application</b></p>
        <p>Description: <b>The customer will be able to use this application in order to rent bikes from stations all over across the city. The application will be an online platform that tracks and manages all the bikes stored in the company’s stations.</b></p>
        <p>Total effort: <b>170</b></p>
        <p>Developers working: <b>8</b></p>
        <p>Estimated sprints needed: <b>12</b></p>
    </div>

    <h4 id="hintTitle-projectDescription" style="display: none">Description</h4>
    <div id="hintBody-projectDescription" style="display: none">
        <p><b>This is the description of the product.</p></b>
        <p>It is usually written by the product owner, and it describes the <b>vision</b> of what the team is going to do, make or accomplish.</p>
        <p>It should be short, and it should give a clear definition of the <b>value</b> it adds to the market.</p>

    </div>

    <h4 id="hintTitle-projectDevelopersWorking" style="display: none">Developers Working</h4>
    <div id="hintBody-projectDevelopersWorking" style="display: none">
        <p><b>This is the number of developers working in this product.</b></p>
        <p>The developers are considered a team, and they should have all the skills necessary to take the vision of the product owner and make it a reality. In a team, there are <b>no roles</b>, and everybody (if possible) is involved in all the phases of the development process.</p>
        <p>The number of recommended developers ranges from <b>3</b> to <b>9</b>. More than that and it gets complicated for team members to collaborate properly.</p>
        <p>If the number of developers is not stable (which is not recommended), you should leave it at <b>0</b>.</p>

    </div>

    <h4 id="hintTitle-projectEstimatedSprintsNeeded" style="display: none">Estimated Sprints Needed</h4>
    <div id="hintBody-projectEstimatedSprintsNeeded" style="display: none">
            <p><b>The number of sprints required to finish the product are stated here.</b></p>
            <p>At the beginning, it is quite difficult to accurately predict the estimated sprints needed unless the team has worked in the past together. A number should nevertheless be stated, as it helps in the product burndown chart, where an ideal sprint effort burn is calculated, and which helps the team with tracking progress and improving overall.</p>
            <p>This number should always change, depending on the <b>average velocity</b> of the <b>previous sprints</b>.</p>
            <p>If a prediction is not possible, then this should be set to <b>0</b>, but the ideal sprint burn will not be calculated.</p>

    </div>

    <h4 id="hintTitle-readySprint" style="display: none">Ready Sprint</h4>
    <div id="hintBody-readySprint" style="display: none">
            <p><b>This is the Ready Sprint.</b></p>
            <p>When this is shown, the sprint is in a <b>ready state</b>.</p>
            <p>During the ready state, <b>items</b> can be <b>added</b>, <b>updated</b> or <b>deleted</b> from the sprint backlog. An item can be added to the sprint backlog, by clicking on the <b>“Move to Sprint”</b> button, next to each item, in the product backlog. </p>
            <p>The user has the ability to either <b>move</b> a <b>set</b> of items at once (by moving epics/stories), or by moving tasks/bugs <b>individually</b>. When the sprint is initialized however, only <b>tasks</b> and <b>bugs</b> will be taken into account during the task board view.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 id="hintTitle-activeSprint" style="display: none">Active Sprint</h4>
    <div id="hintBody-activeSprint" style="display: none">
        <p><b>This is the Active Sprint.</b></p>
        <p>When this is shown, the sprint is in an <b>active state</b>.
        <p>During the active state, items <b>cannot be added</b> or <b>deleted</b> from the sprint. What is included inside the active sprint, stays in the active sprint, until the end of it.<p>
        <p>A timer is set, which is based on the duration configured for the sprint. When it expires, all the items that were included in the sprint, will have one of the following behaviours:<p>
        <ul>
        <li>If the item is <b>done</b>, then it will <b>disappear</b> from the sprint backlog, and it can only be accessed through the sprint history or the project progress.</li>
        <li>If the item is <b>not done</b>, then it will <b>stay</b> in the sprint backlog of the next ready sprint, with the status that it had, before the active sprint was finished.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the product owner decides to finish the sprint earlier for whatever reason, he can do so by <b>clicking</b> the <b>“Finish”</b> button.<p>

    </div>

    <h4 id="hintTitle-sprint-goal" style="display: none">Sprint Goal</h4>
    <div id="hintBody-sprint-goal" style="display: none">
            <p><b>This is the goal that the team is trying to achieve, by the end of the sprint.</b></p>
            <p>A sprint goal <b>shows</b> the desired <b>outcome</b> of an iteration and ensures that everyone is on the <b>same page</b>.</p>
            <p>This is usually done by the product owner, but the team may also contribute. After the goal is defined, it should be <b>accepted</b> by the stakeholders and especially the <b>customer</b>.</p>
            <p>An example goal, could be something like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Develop the checkout process of the application.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Allow teachers to view and update grades.</b>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>After the end of the sprint, the team checks on the goal, and <b>compares</b> it with the <b>reality</b>. Based on the results, they self-reflect and thrive for improvement.</p>

    </div>

    <h4 id="hintTitle-sprint-duration" style="display: none">Sprint Duration</h4>
    <div id="hintBody-sprint-duration" style="display: none">
            <p><b>This is the duration of the sprint.</b></p>
            <p>The <b>duration</b> of the sprint <b>tracks</b> how much the current iteration should last for. After the duration has <b>passed</b>, the sprint <b>expires</b> and it turns from an <b>active</b> state, to a <b>ready</b> state again which includes all the unfinished tasks.</p>
            <p>The sprint <b>duration</b> should be the <b>same</b> for each sprint, as it helps the team forecast future sprint outcomes and in the calculation of a steady speed of the team.</p>
            <p>The recommended sprint duration is <b>2 weeks</b>, but it can reach up to 30 days (<b>4 weeks</b>).</p>
            <p>The product owner is also able to finish the sprint, earlier than the one that was set initially.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 id="hintTitle-sprint-endDate" style="display: none">Sprint End Date</h4>
    <div id="hintBody-sprint-endDate" style="display: none">
            <p>The day which the sprint will move from <b>active</b> state to <b>ready</b> state.</p>
            <p>It will <b>automatically</b> do so, by the end of the day, which means at <b>23:59:59</b> of the final day of the sprint.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 id="hintTitle-sprint-velocity" style="display: none">Velocity</h4>
    <div id="hintBody-sprint-velocity" style="display: none">
            <p><b>The velocity of the sprint is the number of tasks/bugs finished during the execution of a sprint.</b></p>
            <p>It is calculated by summing up the effort of all the tasks and bugs that are included in the current sprint backlog.</p>
            <p>The sprint velocity helps calculate the <b>team’s speed</b>, which in return, helps in <b>forecasting</b> the future sprints and their results.</p>
            <p>It is the <b>key metric</b> in Scrum, as it works as an <b>indicator</b>, which shows whether the team is improving each sprint, or becomes worse. The more the velocity each sprint, the more the team is improving in working together and finishing user stories and requirements.</p>
            <p>Velocity is used both in the <b>product burndown chart</b>, and the <b>sprint burndown chart</b>. The former helps the product owner in figuring out how many sprints it will take the team to achieve a desired level of functionality that can be shipped, whereas the last helps the team in tracking their progress though out the active sprint and in detecting or solving any problems.</p>
    </div>

        <h4 id="hintTitle-sprintBacklog" style="display: none">Sprint Backlog</h4>
    <div id="hintBody-sprintBacklog" style="display: none">
            <p><b>This is the sprint backlog.</b></p>
            <p>Here are the items that are <b>included</b> in the <b>sprint</b> and which the development team will work on.</p>
            <p><b>Only</b> the development team can <b>decide</b> upon the <b>items</b> they will work on, as they are the ones that better understand the difficulties behind each item, and only they can <b>assess</b> what can be <b>accomplished</b> during a sprint.</p>
            <p>The difference between the product backlog and the sprint backlog is the fact that the product backlog contains everything the team might ever work on, whereas the sprint backlog only contains the items that they will work during one sprint.</p>
            <p>Once a sprint has started, items cannot be added or removed from the sprint backlog. What was in the sprint backlog at the beginning, will stay in that until the end of the sprint. However, since not all are known at the beginning of the sprint, the ability to ‘refine’ the items included in the sprint has been left in. Should the effort be re-calibrated, then the user can do so by updating the item from the item page.</p>
            <p>Once the sprint has finished the items that are done <b>disappear</b> from the <b>sprint backlog</b> (can be accessed from sprint history or project progress), and the items that were left, remain at the state they had before the end of the sprint. In Scrum, there is no such thing as 80% done. Everything that was not done, is <b>added back</b> to the <b>sprint backlog</b> and only the <b>finished items contribute</b> to the sprint’s <b>velocity</b>.</p>
            <p>By the end of each sprint, the team is expected to have finished enough tasks, so that a <b>potentially shippable product</b> (or feature), has been created.

    </div>

    <h4 id="hintTitle-productBacklog" style="display: none">Product Backlog</h4>
    <div id="hintBody-productBacklog" style="display: none">
            <p><b>This is the product backlog.</b></p>
            <p>The product backlog is a list of items that the team may deliver in order to add value to a product and fulfil a specific need of the customer. These items include:</p>
        <b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    New features
                </li>
                <li>
                   Changes to existing features
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bug fixes
                </li>
                <li>
                    Infrastructure changes
                </li>
                <li>
                    Other activities such as knowledge acquisition
                </li>
            </ul>
        </b>

            <p>Anyone can add to the backlog, but the essential items come from the product owner as well as the customer and they are <b>sorted</b> from the <b>most important item</b>, to the least important one.</p>
            <p>The product backlog is a <b>living document</b>. It always changes and evolves according to the feedback received from the customer. A healthy backlog would always grow instead of shrinking.</p>
            <p>One of the major activities that is done within the team in collaboration with the product owner, is something called <b>backlog refinement</b>.</p>
            <p>The backlog refinement helps the team in achieving clarity as well as understanding the scope and the vision. The backlog refinement includes the following topics:</p>
        <b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Estimation of effort
                </li>
                <li>
                    Decomposition of large product backlog items (PBIs) into smaller ones
                </li>
                <li>
                    Clarification of requirements
                </li>
            </ul>
        </b>
        <p>Before these topics are explained, the term <b>INVEST</b> concerning items should be understood first. It stands for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Independent</b>: The item dependency should be reduced from one to another. This allows the product owner to create PBIs that are prioritized by business value rather than technical efficiencies.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Negotiable</b>: The customer, the product owner as well as the team must work together daily for the maximum potential value to be reached.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Valuable</b>: A PBI should be developed around the customer needs, so that the business value is clear and existent.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Estimable</b>: If the team is not able to clearly estimate a PBI, then it should be broken into smaller pieces where it is further understood.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Small</b>An individual PBI should be very small, so that it is doable in the 1/4th of a sprint. Doable includes full testing, integration, refactoring etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Testable</b>: Full coverage (including edge cases) should be clear and doable amongst the team for each PBI.
            </li>
        </ul>
            <p>The team together with the product owner sit together in a room and discuss the topics formerly stated above.</p>
            <p><b>Estimation of effort</b></p>
            <p>Each item is presented to the team. The team is asked to write down on a piece of paper the level of difficulty for each of the items. In this application, the easiest starts from 1 and ends to 10 which is the hardest. Afterwards, they are required to explain the reasoning behind the number they chose. This is called <b>Planning Poker</b> and helps in forming discussions between the team as well as revealing valuable information that was not clear before to the whole team.</p>
            <p><b>Decomposition of large product PBIs into smaller ones</b></p>
            <p>If something is not clear enough, then the PBI should be broken into a smaller one. This not only helps in clarifying things, but also controlling the amount of work the team will be able to do during a sprint. An <b>Epic</b>, which is the largest item, should be broken down into <b>User Stories</b> and user stories should be broken down into <b>Tasks/Bugs</b>, which will be added to the sprint.</p>
            <p><b>Clarification of Requirements</b></p>
            <p>The product owner should make the requirements of the customer clear and the vision he set for the product. This helps the team understand the product better as a whole and allows them to revolve around adding customer value instead of technical value.</p>
            <p><b>Some notes</b>: The product backlog should <b>NEVER</b> contain <b>stray user stories</b> or <b>tasks</b>. The proper structure a backlog should follow, is something like this: <b>Epics</b> broken into <b>User Stories</b> broken into <b>Tasks/Bugs</b>. However, the developer has left the ability to have stray stories and tasks in the backlog, but it is not recommended.</p>

    </div>

    <h4 id="hintTitle-createItem-title" style="display: none">Item Title</h4>
    <div id="hintBody-createItem-title" style="display: none">
        <p><b>This is the title of the item.</b></p>
        <p>It should be as <b>short</b> as possible, and as <b>clear</b> as possible, for the team to understand what it is about.</p>
        <p>A title usually describes in a few words either a <b>feature</b> that will be part of the product or technical aspects such as <b>bugs</b>.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 id="hintTitle-createItem-description" style="display: none">Item Description</h4>
    <div id="hintBody-createItem-description" style="display: none">
        <p><b>This is the description of the item.</b></p>
        <p>The description of the item should directly explain what this item is about. A common method used by Agile enthusiasts in order to describe an item, is the following:</p>
        <p><b>As a <role> I can <capability> so that <goal>.</b></p>
        <p>However, this is only an example, not a prescription and any method found appropriately during team discussion can be used.</p>
        <p><b>Some notes:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A <b>PBI</b> is more about the <b>what</b>, whereas a <b>Task</b> or a <b>Bug</b> is more about the <b>how</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                A well-formed description of a PBI represents a distinct business value, whereas a task represents a step from the team to create that value.
            </li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <h4 id="hintTitle-createItem-acceptanceCriteria" style="display: none">Item Acceptance Criteria</h4>
    <div id="hintBody-createItem-acceptanceCriteria" style="display: none">
            <p><b>This is the acceptance criteria of an item.</b></p>
            <p>The acceptance criteria of an item are the specifications of when the <b>item</b> is considered <b>done</b>.</p>
            <p>Acceptance criteria can be the ability to work on a specific platform, or the level of satisfaction and feedback received by the customer.</p>
            <p>Usual examples of when an item is considered done include:</p>
        <b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Properly tested

                </li>
            </ul>
        </b>
            <p><b>Some notes</b>: These specifications mainly concern tasks and bugs during a sprint execution, but they can also be used in the definition of a PBI and outside sprints.</p>

    </div>

    <h4 id="hintTitle-createItem-itemType" style="display: none">Item Type</h4>
    <div id="hintBody-createItem-itemType" style="display: none">
            <p><b>This is the type of an item.</b></p>
            <p>An item can be an <b>Epic</b>, a <b>User Story</b>, a <b>Task</b> or a <b>Bug</b>.</p>
            <p><b>Epics</b> are large bodies of work that can be broken down into many small individual pieces (user stories). They help the team define a <b>structure</b> for the product, as they usually represent huge chunks and core features of the product. They are used to create a <b>hierarchy</b> and they usually require more than one sprint to reach a finished state. This is due to the fact that by the end of each sprint, customer feedback may add more items or new needs may be discovered.</p>
            <p><b>Stories</b> are in a way, software system requirements but from the <b>perspective</b> of the <b>customer</b>. They are formed using language that the end user understands, without any technical slangs and they provide context for the team to better understand the customer and realize the reasons behind what the team is building or the value these stories create. Stories are a few <b>sentences</b> in colloquial language that describe the <b>desired outcome</b> of a feature.</p>
            <p><b>Tasks/Bugs</b> are the smallest unit of work possible. They are created during the backlog refinement phase, where the team discusses in technical detail, how each story should be handled and solved. Tasks/Bugs are a set of technical descriptions that only concern the team and provide the ability to clearly see how each software requirement will be developed, tested, integrated etc. These are the only types of item that count in a sprint, and the calculation of the sprint velocity.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 id="hintTitle-createItem-parent" style="display: none">Item Parent</h4>
    <div id="hintBody-createItem-parent" style="display: none">
            <p>An <b>epic</b> can only contain <b>user stories</b>.</p>
            <p>A <b>user story</b> can only contain <b>tasks</b> or <b>bugs</b>.</p>
            <p>A <b>task</b> or a <b>bug</b> are the smallest item possible and <b>cannot contain</b> any other form of item.</p>
            <p>It is recommended that only epics are included in the backlog, which in return contain user stories that have their own tasks and bugs.</p>
            <p>However, the developer has left the ability to contain stray stories and tasks/bugs in the backlog, in case they want to be saved for editing later during the product development.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 id="hintTitle-createItem-itemPriority" style="display: none">Item Priority</h4>
    <div id="hintBody-createItem-itemPriority" style="display: none">
            <p><b>This is the priority of an item.</b></p>
            <p>It describes how <b>important</b> an <b>item</b> is. This mainly concerns the product backlog, as it is <b>sorted</b> from the most important item to the least important one. This clarifies to the team, which of the PBIs, are the most <b>essential</b> to <b>complete</b> and the most important from the perspective of the <b>customer</b>. Finishing important items first, adds customer value to the product.</p>
            <p><b>Some notes</b>: Priority can be given to any of the items created, whether they are epics or tasks, as they help the team prioritize in any case, but only the PBIs are sorted and not their children.</p>

    <div id="hintBody-createItem-effort" style="display: none">
            <p><b>This is the effort of an item.</b></p>
            <p>The effort is how <b>difficult</b> an <b>item</b> is, according to the team. It is a way of expressing how much <b>time</b>, the rate of <b>difficulty</b>, the <b>technical expertise</b> etc. required to implement a product backlog item or any other piece of work.</p>
            <p>It is <b>calculated</b> amongst the <b>team</b>, during the discussion with the product owner and the <b>backlog refinement phase</b>. It is done during the <b>planning poker</b> part, where each team member writes down on a piece of paper, their personal estimate of how difficult they believe the item is. After revealing the cards and discussing with the other team members, the team agrees to an <b>average</b> effort required by the item.</p>
            <p>What matters is not how much the number representing the item is, but the <b>ratio</b> in comparison with the other items. If for example an item has an effort of 1, and another item has an effort of 3, it means that the latter requires triple the amount of work of the first.</p>
            <p>Agile enthusiasts may not use the effort system, but one of their own. It depends on the team and their ability to understand and <b>represent effort</b> in their own way. For example, a team may use as a metric, the number of cookies that are consumed during the development and implementation of an item.</p>
            <p>In this application, the effort is estimated using the <b>decimal system</b>. <b>1</b> is for the <b>lowest</b> effort, whereas <b>10</b> is for the <b>highest</b> effort. Any more or less than that is not possible, and the system will reset it to one of the edge numbers.</p>

    <div id="hintBody-createItem-assignee" style="display: none">
            <p><b>This is the assignee of the item.</b></p>
            <p>The product owner has the ability to <b>assign</b> someone who will be responsible for the <b>completion</b> of the <b>item</b>.</p>
            <p>If it is a task, he or she will be able to move it in the task board, and whenever they are done, they will be able to assign it to somebody else.</p>
            <p>In Agile, and especially Scrum, practices such as <b>pair programming</b> and daily <b>collaboration</b> and <b>discussion</b> are encouraged, and the team should always work together towards the completion of an item.</p>
            <p><b>Some notes</b>: The product owner can modify an item (including deletion), whereas assignees can only move tasks in the task board or assign new team members to work on the item.</p>

            <p>In the “To Do” list, all the items that have been <b>added</b> to the sprint backlog prior the sprint execution, will be contained.</p>
            <p>These are the items that the development team will have to work on during the sprint execution.</p>
            <p>They have <b>not</b> yet <b>tarted</b>, and each team member is assigned to a number of these. When he or she is ready to start working on them, they will have to move it to the “In Progress” list.</p>

    <div id="hintBody-inProgress" style="display: none">
            <p><b>This is the “In Progress” list.</b></p>
            <p>In the “In Progress” list, all the items that the development team is <b>currently working</b> on, are contained.</p>
            <p>They usually come here from the “To Do” list, but they can also be returned back from the “For Review” list.</p>
            <p>It is possible that the <b>assignee</b> might <b>change</b> during this phase of the task.</p>

    <div id="hintBody-forReview" style="display: none">

            <p>In the “For Review” list, all the items that have finished being developed and require further actions such as <b>testing</b>, are included here.</p>
            <p>The developer will usually assign the task to somebody who will test the code, or to somebody who will review it.</p>
            <p>In case the item <b>fails</b> to pass the tests or is not finished for whatever reason, it will <b>return</b> to the “To Do” list or to the “In Progress” list, depending on the team and what they have agreed upon such a case. Some teams may also have secondary tasks that concern the testing of a task. Depending on the outcome of the secondary tasks, the original task will be either moved back, or completed.</p>

    <div id="hintBody-done" style="display: none">
            <p><b>This is the “Done” list.</b></p>
            <p>In the “Done” list, all the items that the development team has <b>finished</b> working on, are contained.</p>
            <p>In order for an item to qualify as “Done”, they will need to have passed the acceptance criteria the team has set for each item individually or collectively. Example criteria may include:</p>
             <b>
                 <ul>
                     <li>

                     </li>
                     <li>
                         Refactoring
                     </li>
                     <li>
                         Ability to ship
                     </li>
                 </ul>
             </b>
            <p>The <b>velocity</b> of the sprint is calculated by <b>summing</b> up all the <b>effort</b> of the <b>finished tasks</b> and <b>bugs</b>.</p>
            <p><b>Some notes</b>: If a task is near completion (but has not been completed yet), it should not be moved to the “To Do” list. It should remain at its current state and added for completion in the next sprint. Avoiding deception is more important than velocity and numbers, as the former helps the team in having a clear view of the product.</p>

    <div id="hintBody-burndownChart" style="display: none">
            <p><b>This is the Burndown Chart.</b></p>
            <p>The <b>burndown chart</b> is a <b>graphical representation</b> of the amount of <b>work</b> left to do in comparison with the <b>duration</b> of the sprint.</p>
            <p>It is being used by the development team in order to <b>track</b> their <b>progress</b> and evaluate the outcome of the sprint. Some examples of how it helps the team include:</p>
            <b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                      If work finishes early, it might mean that not serious commitment is done by the team.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the amount of work is above the ideal line, it might mean that a task includes way too more work than expected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the amount of work is represented by a sharp drop, it might mean that the effort for the items completed might not have been estimated accurately.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </b>
            <p>In this application, the <b>vertical axis</b> describes the <b>effort</b> and the <b>horizontal axis</b> shows the <b>days</b> until the competition of the sprint.</p>
            <p>The burndown chart starts from the <b>total effort</b>, and every day, the amount of effort burned by the team is calculated.</p>
            <p><b>Ideally</b> there will be a <b>steep downward slope</b> which leads to <b>0</b> effort remaining. When it reaches <b>0</b>, it means that all the <b>items</b> contained into that sprint have been <b>completed</b> and the sprint should be finished.</p>
            <p><b>Some notes</b>: Some teams may add new tasks and bugs during the sprint execution which leads to the effort remaining to increase, before going down. This application does not offer this capability as it supports the idea of having a sprint backlog, without the ability to add or remove during sprint executions.</p>

            <p><b>Ideally</b>, there will be a <b>steep downward slope</b> which leads to <b>0</b> effort remaining. When it reaches <b>0</b>, it means that all the items in the product backlog have been finished, and the <b>product</b> has been <b>completed</b>.</p>
